# biopythonprojects

The projects here cover DNA/RNA/proteins sequence analysis, retrive information from different database(eg. obtaining gene information and CDS , combining CDS together to obtain protein sequence) , identify SNP from sequence alignments, finding the sequencing error and also find coverage depth to minimize the sequencing error.
